# danielle-steger-portfolio

## Description

This project involved creating a personal portfolio webpage from scratch using HTML and CSS. This practical project not only helped me to practice using HTML, CSS, and debugging code, it also provides a practical page to use in the future when job searching. You can view this webpage by clicking [here](https://danimsteger.github.io/danielle-steger-portfolio/).
